# Friend Challenge System - Setup Guide

## Overview
The friend challenge system has been polished and separated from the multiplayer mode. Friends can now challenge each other to synchronized trivia battles where both players answer the same questions, and scores are compared at the end.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

**IMPORTANT**: You must run the database schema updates first!

1. **Apply the schema updates**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `docs/friend-challenge-schema-updates.sql`
   - Run the SQL commands
   - This will add missing columns and create new tables for the challenge system

1. **Challenge Invitations**

   - Both players get identical questions
   - Not first-to-answer - both players can take their time (30s per question)
   - Answers are tracked separately for each player

3. **Score Comparison**
   - Final scores are tallied and compared
   - Winner determination (or tie if scores are equal)
   - Challenge results are stored in the database

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Live score tracking during gameplay
   - Notifications for new challenges

**Database Checks:**
```sql
-- Check if schema updates were applied
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'game_lobbies' AND column_name IN ('invited_friend_id', 'categories', 'difficulty', 'lobby_type');

-- Check challenge data
SELECT * FROM friend_challenge_answers WHERE lobby_id = 'your-lobby-id';
SELECT * FROM challenge_results WHERE lobby_id = 'your-lobby-id';
```
